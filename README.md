# Astrocytes Project Data

This repository contains data and scripts used for the astrocytes-related analyses supporting an upcoming article.

## Contents

- `BIANA_phy/`: Network and annotation data used for analyses.
  - Note: A few extremely large files are intentionally excluded due to GitHub file-size limits:
    - `BIANA_phy/all_shortest_paths.txt` (~6 GB)
    - `BIANA_phy/multi-fields_file.txt` (~154 MB)
    - `BIANA_phy/network.method.txt` (~160 MB)
    - `BIANA_phy/drugbank/` (contains files up to ~1.5 GB)
    - `BIANA_phy/go/` (contains files up to ~8.4 GB)
    - `BIANA_phy/sampled_graphs/` (~1.1 GB total)
  - If you need these files, please see the section below on Large Files.

- `GUILDifyTools-main/`: Selected tools and datasets to reproduce overlap and scoring steps:
  - `astrocytes/` (all contents)
  - `clinvar_top5.txt`
  - `overlap2sessions_functions.py`
  - `README.md`
  - `Datos_Genomica_Astrocitos_Baldo.xlsx`
  - `overlap.py`
  - `run_guildify_local.py`

## Large Files

GitHub limits individual files to 100 MB and strongly discourages multiâ€‘GB assets in normal Git history. The excluded files listed above exceed those limits. They should be hosted externally (e.g., Zenodo/OSF/Figshare) and linked here. Once a DOI/URL is available, add it below:

3. Example entry points:
   - `GUILDifyTools-main/run_guildify_local.py`
   - `GUILDifyTools-main/overlap.py`

## Notes

- Only the subset of `GUILDifyTools-main` required for reproduction is included. Other folders (e.g., `old_astrocytes_wrong/`, `quim_astro/`, `scripts/`) are intentionally excluded.
