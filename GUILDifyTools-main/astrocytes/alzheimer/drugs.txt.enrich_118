It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label].     The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].    **Other indications**    ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include:     Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].     Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].    For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].    For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label].     For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].

Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].

DB12129	Tideglusib	investigational; withdrawn	11313622	-	"Tideglusib was initially formulated for the treatment of Alzheimer and progressive supranuclear palsy.[A31601] The raising interest for the use of tideglusib comes from the significant upregulation of GSK-3 in the brain in patients with Alzheimer disease. Its function as a degradant of ?-catenin, was also important, as it prevents the transcription of cell survival genes. All these factors have directed current research towards this kinase as a potential target.[A31603] Alzheimer disease is the most prevalent form of dementia. The most accepted hypothesis to explain this disease is related to the presence of amyloid ?, which triggers a cascade that will alter the Tau protein and provoke synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death.[A31605]     GSK-3 importance in the tissue repair pathway has also pointed out a novel application for tideglusib.

Epinephrine is used as a hemostatic agent. It is also used in treating mucosal congestion of hay fever, rhinitis, and acute sinusitis, to relieve bronchial asthmatic paroxysms, in syncope due to complete heart block or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, for symptomatic relief of serum sickness, urticaria, angioneurotic edema, for resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents, in simple (open angle) glaucoma, for relaxation of uterine musculature and to inhibit uterine contractions. Epinephrine injection can be utilized to prolong the action of local anesthetics [F1247].    In addition to the above, epinephrine is used as an over the counter (OTC) agent for the intermittent symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, tightness of chest and shortness of breath [F2131].

DHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis.
