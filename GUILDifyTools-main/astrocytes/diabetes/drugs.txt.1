DB01050	Ibuprofen	approved	3672	-	"Ibuprofen is the most commonly used and prescribed NSAID. It is very common over the counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]    The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]    Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labor.[A39092]    As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:    * Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]    * Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]    * Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]    * Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]    * Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]    * Minor pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092]    * Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]"	P12104; P09917; P78348; Q8N695; P07204; P31151; P23786; P10415; P35354; P13569; P37231; P07359; Q07869; P23219	0.605374710968	17

It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label].     The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].    **Other indications**    ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include:     Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].     Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].    For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].    For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label].     For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].

Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].

Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).  DHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis. Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis). DHEA may also increase BMD in young women with the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy."

DB12129	Tideglusib	investigational; withdrawn	11313622	-	"Tideglusib was initially formulated for the treatment of Alzheimer and progressive supranuclear palsy.[A31601] The raising interest for the use of tideglusib comes from the significant upregulation of GSK-3 in the brain in patients with Alzheimer disease. Its function as a degradant of ?-catenin, was also important, as it prevents the transcription of cell survival genes. All these factors have directed current research towards this kinase as a potential target.[A31603] Alzheimer disease is the most prevalent form of dementia. The most accepted hypothesis to explain this disease is related to the presence of amyloid ?, which triggers a cascade that will alter the Tau protein and provoke synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death.[A31605]     GSK-3 importance in the tissue repair pathway has also pointed out a novel application for tideglusib.

DB00203	Sildenafil	investigational; approved	5212	-	"Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:    (1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886], and    (2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:  a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850],    b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859], and    c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883]."
